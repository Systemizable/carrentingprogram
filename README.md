This is a Programming 2 project. We were tasked to create in C++, a car rental program, that would first save the user credentials in a either .txt file or .csv file, then provide any encryption for the passwords, then save the rental details as well as the car details also in a .txt file or .csv file, then when a user rents a car, create and alter a PDF file containing the rental info. We seperated each function of the program into 3 parts as seen. Job well done!
